# Video Game Website
# ASP.NET Web Application

## Current Development Stage

This is very much still a work in progress and am in the beginning stages of this web application.

## Objective

This is my first atempt at building a fullstack ASP.NET Web Application and will be experiementing/learning the entire process
from scratch. The purpose of this project is to take my interest in video games and skills in programming to make something
that I can actually use in my day to day life while learning the .NET/C# stack.

## Description

I am currently working on an ASP.NET full stack website project that will allow
users to rank and review the video games they have played. 
The website will also have a feature that allows users to add video games they want to play to a personal queue.
This project utilizes a variety of technologies, including C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website will have a responsive design and will be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive resource for users to share their thoughts on the
video games they have played and discover new titles to try out. As someone learning full stack development,
I am excited to work on all aspects of this project,
from the back-end database design to the front-end user interface.

## Development Environment

Used Visual Studio as the IDE and Windows Powershell to execute Git Commands to manage Version Control
